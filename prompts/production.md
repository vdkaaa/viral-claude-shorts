# Production prompt (for more control)

You don't need this to make a video: in a chat opened in the project folder, dragging the audio in and saying "anima este audio" is enough (the project's `CLAUDE.md` makes Claude follow these same steps). Use this template when you want to give more details: assets, colors, tone or specific scenes.

Open Claude Code in the `viral-claude-shorts` folder, copy the block below and, before sending it, fill in the lines that start with ✏️. Assets and notes are optional: if you don't need them, delete those lines. Claude picks the topic name.

Make an animated video with this repo's pipeline.

- ✏️ **Canal:** `<south-park, curiosidades, videojuegos, deportes…: una carpeta de canales/>`. Lee su `canal.json` (idioma, estilo, voz) y su `formula.md`.
- ✏️ **Audio:** `<path to your audio: wav, mp3 or m4a; you can drag the file in here>`. Pick a short topic name (lowercase, no spaces or accents), create `canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>/` and copy the audio there as `audio.<extension>`. If instead of audio there's a `canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>/script.json`, generate it with `node core/voice.ts canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>`: it comes out in ONE take so the intonation flows. If you write the script yourself, join the ideas with connectors ("verás", "pero", "así que", "por eso", "o sea"); without them it sounds choppy.
- **Style:** the channel's `estilo` (`flat2d` by default)
- ✏️ **Assets (optional):** `<paths to logos or screenshots>`; copy them to `canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>/assets/`
- ✏️ **What I want to get across:** `<the idea in one sentence>`
- ✏️ **Notes (optional):** `<colors, tone, specific scenes, things to avoid>`

Follow these steps and don't skip the storyboard approval:

1. **Read** `styles/flat2d/USAGE.md` and look at the example video (`ejemplos/blue-sky/scenes.json` and `visuals.ts`) to copy how it works.
2. **Transcribe and analyze:**
   - `.venv/bin/python core/transcribe.py canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>` (it uses the channel's language; to force another one add `--language <code>`)
   - `node core/analyze.ts canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>`

   The phrase table with every word's `#` index is your clock.
3. **Write the plan** in `canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>/scenes.json`:
   - one scene per idea, 2 to 7 s long, each starting at the word (`from`) where that idea begins. The cut lands in the pause before it. Short connectors ("Verás", "Luego", "O sea") can stay as the tail of the previous scene to give it air;
   - **no animation left half done:** no key closer than 0.7 s to the end of its scene (the validator flags it as an ERROR), and every key-triggered animation lasts 0.5 s at most. Anything continuous (pulses, clouds) loops;
   - `type`: question, object, process, comparison, stat, map, asset or closing;
   - `title`: 40 characters at most, in the language of the audio, and `highlight` must be a word of the title that **is said** in that scene (so it lights up right when it's said);
   - `stat` only when there's a real number; numbers and claims must be verifiable;
   - `keys`: the moments the animation has to react to (`at` = word index).

   Validate with `node core/scenes.ts canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>` and fix it until there are no errors.
4. **Draw** `canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>/visuals.ts` with `defineVisuals({ ... })`, using the style's library and reacting to `K('key')`. Follow the style's rules: fixed technique, determinism, title contrast and the **safe zone**: characters, objects and text inside x 60–940, y 220–1480, because TikTok/Reels/Shorts cover the bottom and the right side with their interface (only backgrounds fill the whole frame). Check the types with `npm run typecheck` and fix it until there are no errors.
5. **Storyboard:** `node core/storyboard.ts canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>`. Look at `storyboard.png` yourself, fix whatever looks wrong (cuts, objects out of frame or in the red zones, unreadable text) and then **show it to me and wait for my approval** panel by panel. Then run `node core/preview.ts canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>`: if the preview is already open (from the setup or another chat) it reloads with this video, and if not it opens it. Give me the link it prints so I can watch it moving with the audio.
6. **Render:** `node core/render.ts canales/<canal>/videos/<topic>`. If `report.md` has any FAIL, fix it and render again.
7. **Delivery:** the path to `final.mp4`, the report's numbers, what you fixed and what you couldn't verify (for example, you can't listen to the result).
